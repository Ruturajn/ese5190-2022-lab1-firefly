## General Information
- The [hid_keyboard](https://github.com/Ruturajn/ese5190-2022-lab1-firefly/tree/main/hid_keyboard) directory contains the code for **Q4.4**. Our program emulates
    a keyboard, based on the brightness values and gesture control using the *APDS9960* (The Color/Proximity/Gesture sensor). This directory also contains, all
    the libraries associated with the code, all placed in the `lib` folder.
- The [firefly](https://github.com/Ruturajn/ese5190-2022-lab1-firefly/tree/main/firefly) directory contains the code for **Q3.3**, in which the *blue* LED on the 
    *RP2040* dims, and brightens based on the brightness value obtained from *APDS9960*. As stated above, all the librabries used are placed under the `lib` directory.
- All the other directories follow the same organization, of libraries and code.
